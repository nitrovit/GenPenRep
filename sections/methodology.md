**Phases:**

1. **Planning and Reconnaissance**
   - Gathered information about the target environment.
   - Identified potential entry points.

2. **Scanning**
   - Used tools like Nmap and Nessus to discover open ports and services.
   - Identified vulnerabilities through automated scans.

3. **Enumeration**
   - Detailed examination of identified services and applications.
   - Collected user accounts and network shares.

4. **Exploitation**
   - Attempted to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - Focused on high-impact vulnerabilities.

5. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Assessed the extent of compromise.
   - Evaluated the potential for data exfiltration.

6. **Reporting**
   - Documented all findings with evidence.
   - Provided recommendations for remediation.
