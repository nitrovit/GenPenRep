### Finding 3: Weak Password Policy

**Severity:** Medium

**Description:**

The current password policy allows for weak passwords, increasing the risk of account compromise through brute-force attacks.

**Evidence:**

- Password complexity requirements are minimal (e.g., passwords like "password1" are accepted).
- No account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts.
- Successfully cracked 70% of user passwords using a common wordlist.

**Impact:**

- Unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Potential for privilege escalation if administrative accounts are compromised.
- Increased risk of data breaches.

**Recommendation:**

- Enforce strong password policies requiring a mix of characters.
- Implement account lockout after a defined number of failed attempts.
- Educate users on creating secure passwords.
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication.
